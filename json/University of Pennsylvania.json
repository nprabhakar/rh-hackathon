Did that sound stuffy? It felt stuffy. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re really about:\nPenn is a place for people who want to do something big. But it\u2019s also for people for who want to try a bunch of little things first. It\u2019s a place for sparking revolutionary ideas. For pioneering thinkers. And it\u2019s a place that will help you figure out what inspires and excites you. Where you won\u2019t just gain knowledge, you\u2019ll make it. You\u2019ll research solutions, invent ideas, engineer art \u2013 all in a culture that\u2019s not about perfection, but about perfecting the pursuit.\nThe people who love it here? People who are drawn to other people and who are curious about everything. This is the time to figure things out. Try everything that seems worthwhile. You\u2019ll find what truly is.\nSound like the place for you? Then we can\u2019t wait to meet you.\nLearning at Penn\nLiving at Penn\nAffording Penn\nMajors and Minors", "url": "https://admissions.upenn.edu/", "location": "34TH & SPRUCE ST\nPHILADELPHIA, PA 19104", "application_deadline": "January 5", "acceptance_rate": "7%", "sat_range": "1500-1570", "act_range": "34-35", "application_fee": "$75", "is_sat_act": "Considered but not required", "high_school_gpa": "Required", "application_website": null, "net_price_per_year": "$26,123", "avg_total_aid_per_year": "$57,175", "students_receiving_aid": "57%", "offers_online_courses": "Yes", "programs_offered_entirely_online": "15", "full_time_undergrad": "10,412", "median_earnings_6_years_after_graduation": "$85,900", "graduation_rate": "96%", "employed_2_years_after_grad": "91%"}
