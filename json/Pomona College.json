{"college_name": "Pomona College", "rank": "#2 in Best Liberal Arts Colleges in America", "grade": "A+", "description": "From Pomona College\nPomona College has everything you might expect from one of the nation\u2019s finest liberal arts colleges. But before you assume we're generic, consider that we are within an hour of mountains, deserts, beaches and the country\u2019s second largest city. Our Los Angeles-adjacent location is as stellar a launching pad for those in the arts as those interested in tech and science research.\nPomona is also one of the 5 Claremont Colleges, a consortium enabling its students to cross-register for 2,700 classes and mingle with over 6,000 peers across our adjacent campuses. So even though our small classes (averaging 13), strength across the curriculum (with 48 majors) and tight-knit residential life (4 years guaranteed housing) might seem common, Pomona College is unique.\nPomona College is one of a handful of institutions committed to need-blind admissions and meeting the full demonstrated financial need of all students who enroll. We do not include loans in our aid packages.\nWhy Pomona?\nExplore Our 48 Majors\nCampus Life\nScholarships & Grants", "url": "https://www.pomona.edu/", "location": "333 N COLLEGE WAY\nCLAREMONT, CA 91711", "application_deadline": "January 8", "acceptance_rate": "7%", "sat_range": "1480-1560", "act_range": "33-35", "application_fee": "$80", "is_sat_act": "Considered but not required", "high_school_gpa": "Considered but not required", "application_website": null, "net_price_per_year": "$19,962", "avg_total_aid_per_year": "$57,848", "students_receiving_aid": "55%", "offers_online_courses": "No", "programs_offered_entirely_online": "0", "full_time_undergrad": "1,739", "median_earnings_6_years_after_graduation": "$58,100", "graduation_rate": "95%", "employed_2_years_after_grad": "90%"}
